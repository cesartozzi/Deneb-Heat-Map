# Brazilian Deaths Data ETL & Visualization

This repository contains the tools to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of historical deaths data in Brazil, along with a Vega JSON template for a heat map visualization and a Power BI file for interactive reporting.
This process was explained in [My Blog](https://medium.com/@cesartozzi/building-custom-visualizations-with-power-bi-and-deneb-c4aec971a9ef)


## Overview

- **ETL Process:** A Python script automates the download of yearly data from the OpenDataSUS portal, processes it, and prepares it for visualization.
- **Heat Map Visualization:** A Vega JSON template is provided to create a heat map displaying the processed data.
- **Power BI Integration:** A Power BI file is included that leverages the processed data and the Vega visualization for a comprehensive interactive report.
